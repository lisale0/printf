.SH NAME
.B _printf - format data and print output into stdout
.SH SYNOPSIS
.IP
.I #include "holberton.h"
.IP
.I int _printf(const char *format, ...);
.IP
.I _printf [FORMAT][ARGUMENT]...

.SH DESCRIPTION

The functions in _printf() produces output according to the format specifiers provided below. Each argument passed into _printf is written out into stdout, the standard output stream. The format controls the output in _printf.

.SH RETURN VALUE
Upon a successful return, _printf will return the number of characters printed. Null byte used to end string outputs is excluded. _printf will return an exit status of -1 upon failure.

.SH FORMAT OF FUNCTION
The format of _printf is a character string and can include zero or more format specifiers, each matching zero or more arguments being passed in. Each format specifier begans with "%" followed by the character to the specific format specifier such as "%s". By default, arguments passed in must followed the order of the each format specifier. For example:
.IP 
.B _printf("This is a %s of %d", "string", 5);
.IP
.B $ "This is a string of 5"
.SH FORMAT SPECIFIERS
.IP s
The argument passed for specifier "%s" is a literal string in consta char *, which will be a pointer to an array of character type that points to a string. Characters from the array are written up to (but not including ) the terminating null bye ('/0').
does not take any options. However, you can supply studentname.
.IP c
The argument passed for specifier "%c" is of type int. which is then converted to an unsigned char, which is then written. 
.IP %
The argument passed is not converted and will simply be written as "%". To write out "%", format must be "%%". 
.IP d,i
The argument passed for specifiers "%d" and "%i" is an int argument converted into signed decimal notation. In _printf, the specifiers are handled the same way. The precision functionality, the number of digits that appears in beginning, is still in development and will be added at an later time.
.IP r
The argument passed for specifier "%r" has the same conversion functionality as "%s", but writes the output into the buffer in reverse order.
.IP R
The argument passed for specifier "%R" converts the argument from a string literal into rot13.
.IP o,u,x,X
The argument passed for specifiers "%o", "%u", "%x", and "%X" are handled as follows:
.IP
"%o" takes in an unsigned integer and converts the argument into an unsigned octal.
.IP
"%u" takes in an unsigned integer and converts the argument into an unsigned decimal
.IP
"%x","%X" takes in an unsiged integer and converts the argument into an unsigned hexadecimal. For "x", letters "abcdef" are used while for "X", letters "ABCDEF" are used.
.IP p
The void * pointer argument is printed in hexadecimal
.IP r
The argument passed in, as a string, is reversed.
.IP R
The argument passed in, as a string, is converted into the rot13 format.

.SH BUGS
No known bugs.
.SH DEVELOPER(s) NOTES
This _printf function currently does not support special flags [+ , - , `, \0 , #], field, width or precision. They are currently in development.
